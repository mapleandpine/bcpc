Bridge City is a competitive Dragon Boat and Outrigger Canoe Club in Portland, Oregon. We are a 501(c)3, non-profit organization.

Never paddled before and want to try it? We welcome anyone with a competitive spirit and interest in working hard on and off the water. We paddle hard and we work hard to give back to the community.

Check out our practice schedule and let us know if you have any questions or want to give paddling a try by emailing <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>.
