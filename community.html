					<p>Bridge City Paddling Club was incorporated on January 8, 2010 as an Oregon non-profit corporation to foster, promote, and to participate in, national and international competition in the sports of amateur dragon boat and outrigger canoe racing.</p>
					<p>Our philosophy is "many boats, one team." We have a strong community outreach program to help and make a difference in our local community.  We sponsor the Dawn to Dusk paddle each summer to raise money for the Children's Cancer Association.</p>
					<p>We are a 501(c)3, non-profit organization.</p>

					<h3>High School Teams</h3>
					<p>The Bridge City AquaRockets joined the club in the summer of 2014 and were formerly the Franklin AquaRockets.  Most of the participants attend Franklin High School in Portland, but we welcome any high school students to participate.  The youth team practices primarily during the spring and summer and race at Rio Tinto Alcan Dragon Boat Festival in Vancouver, BC and one or more local races.  </p>
					<h3>Other Teams</h3>
					<p>We also have a mixed team, Bridge City Blitz, which is a two boat racing team formed from Bridge City Team Velocity and Bridge City Men.</p>
					<h3>Members</h3>
					<p>We had 104 members at the end of 2014, compared with 86 members at the end of 2013.  Our members range in age from 16 to 68 with an average age of 38.  Adult members pay $220 per year in paddling dues.   Youth pay $25 per year.   Paddlers also pay race fees and travel expenses.</p>
					<h3>Races and Festivals</h3>
					<p>We generally go to four to six dragon boat festivals in the western United States and Canada and seven to ten outrigger distance or sprint events in the Pacific Northwest each summer.  We enter three to six teams in each event.</p>
					<h3>Accredidations and Associations</h3>
					<p>We are members of PNWORCA (Pacific Northwest Outrigger Racing Association) and the Pacific Dragon Boat Association (PDBA).</p>
					<p>We rent outrigger and dragon boats from DragonSports USA.  We purchased our first outrigger racing canoe in April, 2013.</p>

Bridge City Paddling Club has an active community outreach program helping and raising money for other non-profit organizations in our community.  We generally have two major events a year where we practice "competitive philantrophy" using our strong backs, team spirit, and competitive focus to help organizations such as the Special Olympics of Oregon and the Children's Cancer Association.
