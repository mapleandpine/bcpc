					<p>Bridge City Paddling Club was incorporated on January 8, 2010 as an Oregon non-profit corporation to foster, promote, and to participate in, national and international competition in the sports of amateur dragon boat and outrigger canoe racing.</p>
					<blockquote>Our philosophy is "many boats, one team."</blockquote>
					<p>We have a strong community outreach program to help and make a difference in our local community. We sponsor the Dawn to Dusk paddle each summer to raise money for the Children's Cancer Association.</p>
